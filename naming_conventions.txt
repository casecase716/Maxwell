Parent-Child relationships:
This example uses what I like to call the Parent-Child Pattern for declaring this relationship. To use it simply prefix the name of the of the child object with the name of the parent object. I like to separate with a single dash.

// Posts
.post {
  margin: 2em 0;
}
.post-title {
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: normal;
}

Containers:
There is one other pattern that can be used for declaring a parent-child relationship. It's especially handy for a set of objects and their container. I call it the Plural Parent Pattern. Here it is in action for marking up a group of tabs:
.tabs {
  border-bottom: 1px solid silver;
  text-align: center;
}

.tab {
  background: #e5e5e5;
  border: 1px solid silver;
  @include border-top-radius(3px);
  color: #666;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 7px 18px 7px;
  text-decoration: none;
  position: relative;
  top: 1px;
}
